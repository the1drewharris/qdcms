6. Coding Practices
	Sections
	- Each section has index.cfm, layout folder which contains default.cfm, folders for modules.
	- index.cfm is used to switch between modules.
	- default.cfm contains welcome message.
	Modules
	- Each module contains index.cfm and four folders: layout, display, includes and actions
	- Layout folder contains default.cfm and other layout folders.
	- default.cfm contains common display items and switch statement.
	- for each switch statement a file in layout folder is includes.
	- Each layout file may include display or include files.
	- Display files displays something on the screen. They are included in layout files. They are rarely used independently.
	- Include files gets information from the database which can be used by layout and display files.
	- Action files do not display any information on the screen. After the action is performed, control is returned (to layout).
	CSS and JavaScript
	- All javascript files and code should be included in pages via /includes/selectivejs.cfm
	- All css files should be included in pages via /includes/selectivecss.cfm
	File Access Method
	- All coldfusion files with few exceptions are accessed through index.cfm. 
	- If a particular file has to be accessed directly, it should be added to Application.fileaccesslist.
	- Direct access to cfm files has to be minimized as much as possible for security reasons.
	Using cftransaction
	- Never use cftransaction in a function.
	- Always use cftransaction (if possible) while calling a function which executes database query.
	Comments
	- Always write comments at the top of the file
	- On comments section at the top, describe the flow of the program
	
7. Security
	- There is two layers of security controlled by two files: /includes/securitylayer.cfm and /content/blog/includes/blogsecuritylayer.cfm
	- all security variables are set in file /actions/aclaction.cfm
